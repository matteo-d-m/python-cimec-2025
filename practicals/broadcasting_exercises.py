# Exercise 2: Broadcasting with different shapes
# Create a 3D array of shape (2, 3, 4) filled with random numbers between 0 and 1
# Create a 1D array of shape (4,) with values [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Use broadcasting to multiply each element in the last dimension of the 3D array
# by the corresponding value in the 1D array

# Exercise 3: Broadcasting with boolean operations
# Create two arrays:
# - A 2D array of shape (3, 4) with random integers between 0 and 9
# - A 1D array of shape (4,) with values [2, 4, 6, 8]
# Use broadcasting to create a boolean mask where each element in the 2D array
# is greater than the corresponding value in the 1D array
# Then use this mask to set all elements that are greater to 0
