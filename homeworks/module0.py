# Create a variable that checks if a year is a leap year
# A year is a leap year if it's:
# - divisible by 4 AND
# - not divisible by 100, unless it's also divisible by 400 (eg 1700 is not a leap year, 1600 is)
# Test the results with the following years:
year_0 = 1900
year_1 = 2000
year_2 = 2024
year_3 = 2025

year_to_test = year_0  # change this to test other years

is_leap_year = ...

# Create a temperature converter that:
# 1. Takes a temperature in Fahrenheit (use float)
# 2. Converts it to Celsius (google the formula)
# transforming the float result into an int
# 3. Define variables telling you if water would:
#    - freeze (below 0°C)
#    - boil (100°C or above)
#    - or be liquid (between 0-100°C)
# Test with these temperatures:
temp_0 = 32.0    
temp_1 = 212.0   
temp_2 = 98.6    
temp_3 = -40.0

temp_to_test = temp_0  # change this assigment to test other temperatures

temp_in_celsius = ...  # make sure this is an int!
is_frozen = ...
is_boiling = ...
is_liquid = ...   # ensure that only one of these is true for each of the possible temperatures!
