# Submission of final project

The final assignment of the course consists in a small Python project, ideally something that could be useful for your work or some extra-curricular endeavior.  If you have already some half-backed or questionably written project going on, expanding and refactoring would also be suitable ideas! Look below for ideas and examples from last year.

The deadline for the submission is **Friday, the 30th of August 2024**! While you work on the project, feel free to ask for feedback at any point.

### Format
The project should be **uploaded to a public repository in your GitHub**, named `python-cimec-name-surname`. A link to the repository will be the only accepted submission form! (There will be a class about publishing code on GitHub). If you have concerns about leaving it open, let us know and we can discuss it. 

### Project content
Depending on the project, it could consist of one or more notebooks, and/or (encouraged) functions and classes defined in separate `.py` modules.

Make sure you **thoroughly document your code**! Try to write self-explanatory code (meaningful variables names, logical flow...) and add comments where you feel necessary. It shouldn't just work, it should be readable! Take the chance to try doing that well, as you will get feedback about it! If you write notebooks, make sure you use the markdown cells to describe the notebook content and to add all the required explanations to the analysis flow.

### `README.md`
The project **must** feature a `README.md` in the repository with a (schematic) description of the project aims and structure.
Ideally, after a brief description, in the `README.md` you should give some instructions about how to install and run the code. If you want, you can find [here](https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf) a markdown cheatsheet. For some random examples see [here](https://github.com/AlliedToasters/circle-fit), or [here](https://github.com/portugueslab/xiao_et_al]) for the descriptions of different kinds of projects).

### Examples 
To give an idea, reasonable projects could be like:
 - Preliminary analysis of a dataset (with data loading, aggregation, plots...); either original data or from the web
 - Implementing a new experiment / preparing the material to run an experiment (eg images for a stimulus)
 - Refactoring some old code you wrote before (conceptual and not only cosmetic! Avoiding duplicated code, reusability, etc.)
 
Random examples from past year course:
 - A simple neural network for image detection [link](https://github.com/matteo-d-m/python-course-cimec-2023)
 - Analysis of questionnaire data using `pandas` [link](https://github.com/Deb-spg/final_assignment_python_cimec)
 - Workflow refactoring using `pandas` [link](https://github.com/pepstub/project-python_course2023/tree/main)
 - Analysis of behavioral data [link](https://github.com/samsrtn/Final_Python_Project_Sartin)
 - 3D video generation for fMRI data [link](https://github.com/AndreaBelluzzi/final_assignments/tree/main/final_project)


### Final presentations
We will organize a day for chill, short (5 min) presentations of everyone's project after all people have submitted. There will be prizes (and beer)!
